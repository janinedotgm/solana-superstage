## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janinedotgm/solana-superstage-airdrop.git
   cd solana-superstage-airdrop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Environment Variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variable:

   ```plaintext
   AUTH_PWD=your_secure_password
   ```

   Replace `your_secure_password` with a strong password of your choice.

4. **Update the URL in `page.tsx`:**

   Before running the application, you need to replace the default URL in `src/app/page.tsx` with your desired URL. This URL is used for generating Solflare deep links.

   Open `src/app/page.tsx` and locate the following line:

   ```typescript
   const [currentUrl] = useState('https://solana-superstage.vercel.app/');
   ```

   Replace `'https://solana-superstage.vercel.app/'` with your own URL.

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## ðŸ”’ Security Recommendations


*The current setup uses a simple API call for password verification. For enhanced security, consider implementing a more robust authentication mechanism. You can do so by integrating with a third-party authentication provider like Auth0, NextAuth, or Firebase Authentication.*
